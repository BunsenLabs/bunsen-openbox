bunsen-openbox for Debian
-------------------------

At present, this package generates a BunsenLabs copy of 
/usr/lib/*/openbox-autostart, named openbox-autostart.bunsen,
commenting out the line which sets the background colour.
Then dpkg-divert and symlinking are used so that openbox-autostart.bunsen
is used by openbox.

On removal of this package, the original file is restored.
