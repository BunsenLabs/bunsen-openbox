bunsen-openbox
==============

This package modifies the behaviour of the Openbox window manager,
for use with BunsenLabs Linux.

The currently implemented modifications are:

*) Inhibit the setting of a background colour,
which causes a visual blink in the transition
from the login manager background image to the user wallpaper.
(Debian bug #843231, fixed in Openbox 3.6.1-5)
